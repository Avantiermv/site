About me:
Graduating in Computer Science at IFMA(Instituto Federal do Marnh√£o), currently in the 3rd period.
The pragramming languages that i use are JavaScript, HTML and CSS (I know, html and css aren't pragramming languages in fact). I'm also studying TypeScript, Data Structure, OOP and Web Development.

My Story:
I started studying programming and IT at the end of 2021, in 2022 I put on a bit more gas and did a few things in html and css but I didn't get very deep into it as well as in 2023, a lot because of the enem since I was in high school. In 2024 I started studying Computer Science and it was from there that I really began to delve into the area, studying algorithms, programming logic and creating lots of frontend projects to practice. 
In my spare time, I like to play games like Skyrim, read books like The Lord of the Rings, The Silmarillion and The Hobbit, go for walks with my dog and watch fantasy movies like The Hobbit and Lord of the Rings trilogies. I really like LOTR!
