About me:
Graduating in Computer Science at IFMA(Instituto Federal do Marnh√£o), currently in the 3rd period.
The pragramming languages that i use are JavaScript, HTML and CSS (I know, html and css aren't pragramming languages in fact). I'm also studying TypeScript, Data Structure, OOP and Web Development.

My Story:
I started to study about pragramming and tecnology at the end of 2021. In 2022 I put a bit more effort and started studying more and I did some things using HTML and CSS, but nothing involving JavaScript.
